= Trigger =
A trigger is considered to be something that causes another thing to occur. Since meddela is about notifications then a trigger is something that causes a notification to be sent out.

Meddela was created primarly to deal with SQL databases, but since it allows groovy scripting you can deal with almost anything!

For a trigger to occur to things two must be fullfilled:
* A certain time condition is reached
* A certain state of the database is reached or a certain groovy script condition is reached

Meddela uses cron4j for scheduling of triggers, thus the time condition information for meddela is expressed as a CRON string

When a time condition occurs meddela will run either a SQL script or a Groovy script attached to that trigger. If the SQL script returns a resultset which is not empty then meddela knows its time to send out a notification. If a groovy script is used instead and it returns a true value, then meddela knows its time to send out a notification

So to summarise, a trigger in meddela has schedule information, and either a SQL script to run or a Groovy Script to run.

One more thing is added to the trigger, a datasource i.e information on how to connect to a database to run the SQL Script. 

Trigger =  CRON schedule + sql or groovy script + datasource
